There are lots of ways this level could be done. The intended way is by the use of the "tr" command, but you could also write a small code to decode the ROT13.


TR METHOD:

cat data.txt | tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'
The password is 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4


CODE METHOD:

import string

encrypted = "Gur cnffjbeq vf 7k16JArUVv5LxVuJfsSVdbbtaHGlw9D4"
decrypted = ""

lowercase = string.ascii_lowercase
uppercase = string.ascii_uppercase

for char in encrypted:
    if char.isupper():
        decrypted += uppercase[uppercase.index(char) - 13]

    elif char.islower():
        decrypted += lowercase[lowercase.index(char) - 13]

    else:
        decrypted += char

print(decrypted)
