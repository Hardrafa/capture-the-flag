Well... I took while in this level, honestly (mostly due to small mistakes in the script and permission). First thing you need to do is create a temporary directory with mktemp -d, then make sure that bandit24 can create files inside it (cause he is the one executing the script).

What the script itself needs to do is read what is inside one of the many files inside the foo folder. In my case I used stat to print the name of the file and then printed the contents below, what lead me to a file called tmp.z0vISylWGJ. This file reveals the place where the password is, which was /tmp/tmp.3Ngm5AfXJv
