So basically you are not entering bandit32's account, but actually bandit33 that is using a bash shell that modifies your input before executing commands. However, it only modifies letter, not special characters nor numbers.
Well, so you just have to expand to the shell being executed using $0 (I say "just" but I actually spent more than an hour reading through the bash manual to find this), with that you'll be given a shell and can open the bandit33 password.

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33
