Pretty easy to see it's a SQL injection. You just input any strange characters in the password field and you'll see some SQL errors, proving it's possible to perform an injection. 

According to the source code, the query goes like this:

SELECT * from users where username="" and password=""

So you need to make it so it shows it matches something in the table. For that, you can make a condition that's always true in the password. In this case, " OR ""=", that will always be true because the query would go like this:

SELECT * from users where username="" and password="" OR ""=""
